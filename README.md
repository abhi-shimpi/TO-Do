## To-Do App

### Overview
This To-Do app is a simple and efficient task management tool that I developed using a combination of backend and frontend technologies. The app allows users to create, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and manage their daily activities effectively.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js:** Provides the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.
  - **Express.js:** Serves as the backend framework, facilitating the handling of routes, middleware, and HTTP requests.
- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used to create the user interface and ensure a responsive design.
  - **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Template engine that helps render dynamic content on the web pages.

### Features
- **Task Management:** Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Utilizes EJS templates to dynamically render content based on user interactions.

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `node index.js`.
4. Access the app locally via `http://localhost:8800`.

This project showcases my ability to build full-stack applications using a combination of modern backend and frontend technologies.
